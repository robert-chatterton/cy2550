For Project 1, I investigated Lockwise, LastPass, and NordPass. 
I liked how LastPass had some nice premium features, such as up to a GB of encrypted file storage,
but I decided not to go with that because Lockwise is basically built in to Firefox, the main
browser that I use. For a free password manager, its worked well for me the past week or so.
